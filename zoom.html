There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now and, and when I wake up
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together

		<div class="para1">
			I honestly don't know where to start. <br>
			Maybe with an, <b><i> I love you! </i></b><br>
			Does it really matter? <br>
			Nag-start nga tayo in a not so good way eh. HAHAHA <br>

			Habang ginagawa ko 'to, hindi ko maintindihan maffeel ko <br>
			It's like a mix of pagiging speechless and bursting with words, <br>
			Andami kong pwedeng sabihin or maikwento <br>
			Since I think our love is that great! <br>
			Sobrang surreal sa pakiramdam at maisip na <br>
			I'm still with the same person I'm with a year ago. <br>
			It's funny how, a year ago, wala akong paki sa love, <br>
			wala akong paki sa kung anong mangyayari sa future ko <br>
			(Since I'm alone naman.)<br><br>
			But then along came <b><i>YOU</i></b><br><br>
			You showed me that there was so much more to life! <br>
			It doesn't end in just 
			a bad day, <br>
			bad week, <br>
			bad month. <br>
			You showed me na may chance pa ako at reaching the goals I want. <br>
			Life wasn't such a bad idea after all, thanks to you. <br><br><br>
			Thank you for being patient palagi sa'kin. hehehehe <br>
			I just wish I could do the same for you. <br>
			I wish the best for us, in every way, always. <br>
			I may not be the best, but I'm alwaaays trying! <br>
			You deserve the all hte good stuff in this universe. <br>
			Mahal na mahal kita. <br>

			Kapag sinabi kong mahal kita, ang ibig kong sabihin <br>
			Napapagod din ako - <br>
			&nbsp;nanginginig ang aking kalamnan, <br>
			&nbsp;nalalambot ang aking mga tuhod, <br>
			&nbsp;nanlalamabot ang aking mga braso.
			<br><br>
			Dahil kapag sinabi kong mahal kita, ang ibig kong sabihin <br>
			<i>Pagpapaguran ko ito</i>
			<br><br>
			Hihintayin kita.&nbsp;Susundan.&nbsp;Susuyuin.
			<br><br>
			Dahil ang aking mahal kita ay hindi nagtatapos <br>
			sa mahal lang kita. <br>
			Ang aking mahal kita ay may pagtanggap na ito... <br>
			<i>Ito ang hirap na kalakip ng pag-ibig. <br>
			Yakpin mo.</i>
			<br><br>
			Mahal, kapag sinabi mong mahal kita, ang ibig kong sabihin <br>
			<i>Malupit ang mundo at mamahalin ko ang lahat ng kakampi mo.</i> <br>
			Kaya hayaan mong dumating ang mga bagyo. <br>
			Hayaan mong malusaw ako ng araw. <br>
			Hayaan mo akong kumbinsihin ka na kakampi rin ako. <br><br>
			Ikaw na hantungang inaasam, <br>
			ikaw na kuwentong hindi pagsasawaan, <br>
			ikaw na sandaling parating inaalala, <br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;ikaw ang kailangan kong pahinga.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ikaw ang pahinga.</i><br><br><br><br>
			Kapag sinabi kong mahal kita, ang ibig kong sabihin <br>
			<i>Masaya ako.</i><br>
			Dahil mahal, gaano man kahaba ang araw, <br><br><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; uuwi ako sa 'yo. <br><br><br><br>
